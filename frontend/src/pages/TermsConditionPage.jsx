                <li><p>Fraud Awareness Disclaimer -Please note that we have observed there are various methods used to defraud the public including Traya customers through communication made with the unauthorized use of Traya’s name and brand. The fraudsters are falsely presenting themselves as representatives of Traya such as employees, customer service representatives, or agents. Traya and/or its representatives would never seek any financial information such as card details, CVV etc. from you. The purpose of such activities is to induce you to provide sensitive information or to pay a fee through a web-link or through other modes of communication.

                You are strongly advised to use only our official website/ app to communicate with Traya.
